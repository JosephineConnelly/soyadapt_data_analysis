    - on the GenomeDK cluster in BASH

data soybean_resequencing_MQ30.vcf

the PE reads has been adaptor and QC trimmed, aligned to the Williams 82 reference genome, variants called using GATK and finally a asic filtering based on MQ 30 and biallelic sites has been applied. The total number of SNP variants are 3088131.
